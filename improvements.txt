- use all images (instead of max 100 from each class)
- resize to larger than 30x30
- use width-to-length ratio of the object
    = segment image 
        * threshold the image on the mean value (reduces noise)
        * dilate image to connect neighboring pixels
        * calculate labels for connected regions
        * apply the original threshold to the labels to label the original, undilated regions
